# Regex Expressions Explained: Matching a Hex Value

Today I will be discussing the regular expression: matching a hex value. Hex values are commonly used shorthand code for representing a certain color.

## Summary

Hex values have to satisfy certain conditions, they must start with an '#' symbol, the should be follow by letters and/or digits: a-f, A-F, 0-9, and lastly the hexadecimal code length should be 6 or 3, excluding the '#' symbol. We can use the regular expression, [regex = "^#([A-Fa-f0-9]{6}|[A-Fa-f0-9]{3})$";], to verify if a string is a correct hexadecimal value.
